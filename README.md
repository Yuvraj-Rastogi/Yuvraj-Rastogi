### Hey There 👋
I'm a web and Discord bot developer, passionate about programming and constantly striving to learn new technologies. Recently, I've been exploring the exciting fields of Machine Learning and AI.

I've been mastering JavaScript for the past few months, and it has become my go-to language for developing web and bot applications. I love how flexible and versatile it is, and I enjoy exploring its many libraries and frameworks. I'm always looking for new and exciting ways to use JavaScript in my projects, and I'm eager to share my knowledge with other developers.

Feel free to take a look at my projects and don't hesitate to reach out to me for collaborations or just to say hi!
